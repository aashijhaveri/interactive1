<ul>
    
      <li><em>How is art making offline different than art making offline?</em></li><br/>
      
      <p> Art making online has more options to consider. We have several different display sizes, such as mobile phones which are mostly vertical display and laptops that are mostly horizontal display. <br />Art making offline is usually done with the first format that artist create.</p><br/>

      <li><em> How has your view of the internet / how you experience being online changed over time?</em></li><br/>

      <p> I think the design of the display is becoming simple. Designers are leaving more blank spaces/ empty spaces on the page. Also, there are more icons to use space well compared to using all words. Using the empty space has become more important.</p><br/>


      <li><em> How does the Web inpact Graphic Design?</em></li>


      <p>Designers have to think more about the quality of the images. Also, the choice of a typeface is important because it has to be legible, yet attractive to the eye.</p>
